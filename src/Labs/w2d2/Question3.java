/**
 * Question 3. Exploring new ideas: Forward and backward sorted array (FBS array)
 * Definition
 * An array is said to be a FBS array if it satisfies the following three conditions.
 * (1) Elements in the odd locations are sorted in the ascending order.
 * (2) Elements in the even locations are sorted in the descending order.
 * (3) Every element in the even locations are <= every element in the odd locations.
 * Example {7, 20, 10, 19, 10, 17, 14, 15, 15}
 * Devise an algorithm to FBS sort (that will make an array a FBS array). What is the asymptotic
 * running time of your algorithm? What is the fastest possible asymptotic running time for such
 * an algorithm? Justify your answer.
